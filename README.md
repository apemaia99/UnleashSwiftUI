# UnleashSwiftUI
ðŸ“¦ Package cointaining non native SwiftUI components
## Description
ðŸš€ We all love SwiftUI, because it allows us to create graphical interfaces quickly. But sometimes it happens that some components are not available for SwiftUI. So I decided to create this collection of ready-to-use components.
Each component is fully documented with examples as well. You can consult it via Xcode as you are already used to, by pressing <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜ + Show Quick Help</kbd>.
## Installation
ðŸ“² Open your Xcode Project then go to File > Add Packages... and paste this repository link. For more information check out https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app
## Components available
- Non modal experience introduced in iOS 15 only for UIKit (sheet with detents) <code>sheet(isPresented:detents:showGrabber:scrollingExpand:undimmed:edgeRadius:onDismiss:content:)</code>
