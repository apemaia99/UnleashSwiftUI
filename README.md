# UnleashSwiftUI
### We all love SwiftUI, because it allows us to create graphical interfaces quickly. But sometimes it happens that some components are not available for SwiftUI. So I decided to create this collection of ready-to-use components.
Each component is fully documented with examples as well. You can consult it via Xcode as you are already used to by pressing <kbd>‚å•</kbd>.

# Components list
- Non modal experience introduced in iOS 15 only for UIKit <code>sheet(isPresented:detents:showGrabber:scrollingExpand:undimmed:edgeRadius:onDismiss:content:)</code>
